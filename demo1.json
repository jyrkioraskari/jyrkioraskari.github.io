  "description": "One of the [four rules](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) of Linked Data is that Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) should be used for naming things. The [Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVocabularies) further states that vocabularies should be used. Therefore, we make some additions to the dataset.\n\n1. All data instances are converted to URIs by appending `https://someHost.com/PROJ1001#` to each of the names.\n\n2. `<is_a>` is replaced with the [RDF type](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_type) predicate which is used for associating an instance with its class.\n\n3. Classes from the [Building Topology Ontology (BOT)](https://w3id.org/bot) are used to describe the Building, Room and Chair.\n\n4. Properties from BOT are used to describe `<contains_space>` and `contains_element`."
